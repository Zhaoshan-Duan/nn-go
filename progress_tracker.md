### Testing Strategy Evolution

**Milestone:** Completed comprehensive testing strategy overhaul for activation functions package, math utilities package.

**Previous approach:** Simple table-driven tests 

**New approach:** Multi-level testing with:

- **Unit Level:** Known input/output pairs + mathematical properties
- **Component Level:** Realistic scenarios with comprehensive edge cases
- **Integration Level:** Multiple components working together
- **Performance Level:** Benchmarks for speed and memory allocation
- **Error Level:** Invalid inputs and boundary conditions

**Key improvements:**

- Property-based testing for mathematical invariants
- Strategic memory allocation testing (normal, large, infinity, NaN, tiny values)
- Parallel test execution with `t.Parallel()`
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Error-returning constructor with proper validation


Math Utilities achievements:
- Linear scaling performance (0.89ns for 2 elements - 2284ns for 10k elements)
- Zero Memory allocation
- Mathematical property verification (commutativity, distributivity, linearity)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (infinity, NaN, empty vectors, mismatched lengths)

**Next:** Apply this same comprehensive testing approach to `layer` and `network` packages.
