#### Concurrency Consideration

**Current State**: Layer implementation is thread-safe for concurrent read operations (multiple goroutines can call `Forward()` simultaneously) verified through `concurrent_state_consistency` tests. No mutex required for inference-only workloads. Current sequential implementation is optimal for layers <1000 neurons due to goroutine overhead


**Future Concurrency Plans**: Concurrency will be considered after the complete network is implemented and profiled. Batch-level parallelism (process multiple samples concurrently) and Layer-level parallelism (only for layers with >1000 neurons based on benchmarks) are being considered. Implementation will be driven by profiling results.
